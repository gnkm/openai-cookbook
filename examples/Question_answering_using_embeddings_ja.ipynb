    "\n",
    "GPTは2つの方法で知識を学習できます：\n",
    "\n",
    "- モデルの重みを通じて（つまり、訓練セットでモデルをファインチューニングする）\n",
    "- モデルの入力を通じて（つまり、入力メッセージに知識を挿入する）\n",
    "\n",
    "ファインチューニングの方がより自然な選択肢に感じられるかもしれません。結局のところ、データでの訓練はGPTが他のすべての知識を学習した方法だからです。しかし、一般的にモデルに知識を教える方法としてはお勧めしません。ファインチューニングは特殊なタスクやスタイルを教えるのに適しており、事実の記憶については信頼性が低いのです。\n",
    "\n",
    "例えて言うなら、モデルの重みは長期記憶のようなものです。モデルをファインチューニングするとき、それは1週間後の試験のために勉強するようなものです。試験当日になると、モデルは詳細を忘れたり、読んだことのない事実を誤って記憶したりする可能性があります。\n",
    "\n",
    "対照的に、メッセージの入力は短期記憶のようなものです。メッセージに知識を挿入するとき、それはノートを見ながら試験を受けるようなものです。手元にノートがあれば、モデルは正しい答えにたどり着く可能性が高くなります。\n",
    "\n",
    "ファインチューニングと比較したテキスト検索の欠点の一つは、各モデルが一度に読める最大テキスト量に制限があることです：\n",
    "\n",
    "| モデル           | 最大テキスト長            |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| `gpt-4o-mini`   | 128,000トークン（約384ページ）|\n",
    "| `gpt-4o`        | 128,000トークン（約384ページ）|\n",
    "\n",
    "この例えを続けると、モデルは一度に数ページのノートしか見ることができない学生のようなものと考えることができます。参照できる教科書の棚がたくさんあるにもかかわらず、です。\n",
    "\n",
    "したがって、大量のテキストを活用して質問に答えることができるシステムを構築するには、検索-質問（Search-Ask）アプローチを使用することをお勧めします。"

    "\n",
    "テキストは多くの方法で検索することができます。例えば：\n",

    "\n",
    "埋め込みのみの検索を、あなた自身のシステムの出発点として考えてください。より良い検索システムでは、人気度、新しさ、ユーザー履歴、以前の検索結果との冗長性、クリック率データなどの機能と併せて、複数の検索手法を組み合わせる場合があります。Q&A検索のパフォーマンスは、質問を埋め込む前に仮想的な回答に変換する[HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496)などの技術によっても改善される可能性があります。同様に、GPTも質問を自動的にキーワードセットや検索用語に変換することで、検索結果を改善する可能性があります。"

    "\n",
    "1. 検索データの準備（ドキュメントごとに1回）\n",
    "    1. 収集：2022年オリンピックに関する数百のWikipedia記事をダウンロードします\n",
    "    2. チャンク化：ドキュメントを短く、ほぼ自己完結したセクションに分割して埋め込み処理を行います\n",
    "    3. 埋め込み：各セクションをOpenAI APIで埋め込みます\n",
    "    4. 保存：埋め込みを保存します（大規模データセットの場合は、ベクターデータベースを使用）\n",
    "2. 検索（クエリごとに1回）\n",
    "    1. ユーザーの質問が与えられたら、OpenAI APIからクエリの埋め込みを生成します\n",
    "    2. 埋め込みを使用して、クエリとの関連性によってテキストセクションをランク付けします\n",
    "3. 質問（クエリごとに1回）\n",
    "    1. 質問と最も関連性の高いセクションをGPTへのメッセージに挿入します\n",

Paris was the host city, with events (mainly football) held in 16 additional cities spread across metropolitan France, including the sailing centre in the second-largest city of France, Marseille, on the Mediterranean Sea, as well as one subsite for surfing in Tahiti, French Polynesia.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both bids were praised for their high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris became the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the games in 1908, 1948, and 2012).[5][6] Paris 2024 marked the centenary of Paris 1924 and Chamonix 1924 (the first Winter Olympics), as well as the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics) and the first with this distinction since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. The Summer Games returned to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

Australia finished fourth with 18 gold medals and fifth in the overall medal count. The host nation, France, finished fifth with 16 gold and 64 total medals, and fourth in the overall medal count. Dominica, Saint Lucia, Cape Verde and Albania won their first-ever Olympic medals, the former two both being gold, with Botswana and Guatemala also winning their first-ever gold medals. \n",

    "The ceremony featured music performances by American musician Lady Gaga,[131] French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, heavy metal band Gojira and soprano Marina Viotti [fr],[132] Axelle Saint-Cirel (who sang the French national anthem \"La Marseillaise\" atop the Grand Palais),[133] rapper Rim'K,[134] Philippe Katerine (who portrayed the Greek god Dionysus), Juliette Armanet and Sofiane Pamart, and was closed by Canadian singer Céline Dion.[132] The Games were formally opened by president Emmanuel Macron.[135]\n",

    "The Olympics and Paralympics cauldron was lit by Guadeloupean judoka Teddy Riner and sprinter Marie-José Pérec; it had a hot air balloon-inspired design topped by a 30-metre-tall (98 ft) helium sphere, and was allowed to float into the air above the Tuileries Garden at night. For the first time, the cauldron was not illuminated through combustion; the flames were simulated by an LED lighting system and aerosol water jets.[136]\n",

    "Controversy ensued at the opening ceremony when a segment was interpreted by some as a parody of the Last Supper. The organisers apologised for any offence caused.[137] The Olympic World Library and fact-checkers would later debunk the interpretation that the segment was a parody of the Last Supper. The Olympic flag was also raised upside down.[138][139]\n",

It featured more than a hundred performers, including acrobats, dancers and circus artists.[158] American actor Tom Cruise also appeared with American performers Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and H.E.R. during the LA28 Handover Celebration portion of the ceremony.[159][160] The Antwerp Ceremony, in which the Olympic flag was handed to Los Angeles, the host city of the 2028 Summer Olympics, was produced by Ben Winston and his studio Fulwell 73.[161]\n",

    "Security\n",
    "France reached an agreement with Europol and the UK Home Office to help strengthen security and \"facilitate operational information exchange and international law enforcement cooperation\" during the Games.[46] The agreement included a plan to deploy more drones and sea barriers to prevent small boats from crossing the Channel illegally.[47] The British Army would also provide support by deploying Starstreak surface-to-air missile units for air security.[48] To prepare for the Games, the Paris police held inspections and rehearsals in their bomb disposal unit, similar to their preparations for the 2023 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France.[49]\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of a visit to France by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, several agreements were signed between the two nations to enhance security for the Olympics.[50] In preparation for the significant security demands and counterterrorism measures, Poland pledged to contribute security troops, including sniffer dog handlers, to support international efforts aimed at ensuring the safety of the Games.[51][52] The Qatari Minister of Interior and Commander of Lekhwiya (the Qatari security forces) convened a meeting on 3 April 2024 to discuss security operations ahead of the Olympics, with officials and security leaders in attendance, including Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Sheikh Jassim bin Mansour Al Thani.[53] A week before the opening ceremony, the Lekhwiya were reported to have been deployed in Paris on 16 July 2024.[54]\n",

    "In the weeks running up to the opening of the Paris Olympics, it was reported that police officers would be deployed from Belgium,[55] Brazil,[56] Canada (through the RCMP/OPP/CPS/SQ),[57][58][59] Cyprus,[60] the Czech Republic,[61] Denmark,[62] Estonia,[63][64] Finland,[65] Germany (through Bundespolizei[66][67]/NRW Police[68]),[69] India,[70][71] Ireland,[72] Italy,[73] Luxembourg,[74] Morocco,[75] Netherlands,[76] Norway,[58] Poland,[77] Portugal,[78] Slovakia,[79] South Korea,[80][81] Spain (through the CNP/GC),[82] Sweden,[83] the UAE,[84] the UK,[49] and the US (through the LAPD,[85] LASD,[86] NYPD,[87] and the Fairfax County Police Department[88]), with more than 40 countries providing police assistance to their French counterparts.[89][90]\n",
    "\n",
    "Security concerns impacted the plans that had been announced for the opening ceremony, which was to take place as a public event along the Seine; the expected attendance was reduced by half from an estimated 600,000 to 300,000, with plans for free viewing locations now being by invitation only. In April 2024, after Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack in March, and made several threats against the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, French president Emmanuel Macron indicated that the opening ceremony could be scaled back or re-located if necessary.[91][92][93] French authorities had placed roughly 75,000 police and military officials on the streets of Paris in the lead-up to the Games.[94]\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the end of the Games, the national counterterrorism prosecutor, Olivier Christen, revealed that French authorities foiled three terror plots meant to attack the Olympic and Paralympic Games, resulting in the arrest of five suspects.[95]\n",

       "\"COVID-19 had a significant impact on the 2022 Winter Olympics in several ways:\\n\\n1. **Qualification Changes**: The pandemic led to changes in the qualification process for sports like curling and women's ice hockey due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an Olympic Qualification Event, while the IIHF used existing world rankings for women's ice hockey.\\n\\n2. **Biosecurity Protocols**: The IOC announced strict biosecurity protocols, requiring all athletes to remain within a bio-secure bubble, undergo daily COVID-19 testing, and only travel to and from Games-related venues. Athletes who were not fully vaccinated or did not have a valid medical exemption had to quarantine for 21 days upon arrival.\\n\\n3. **Spectator Restrictions**: Initially, only residents of the People's Republic of China were allowed to attend as spectators. Later, ticket sales to the general public were canceled, and only limited numbers of spectators were admitted by invitation, making it the second consecutive Olympics closed to the general public.\\n\\n4. **NHL Withdrawal**: The National Hockey League (NHL) withdrew its players from the men's hockey tournament due to COVID-19 concerns and the need to make up postponed games.\\n\\n5. **Quarantine and Testing**: Everyone present at the Games had to use the My2022 mobile app for health reporting and COVID-19 testing records. Concerns about the app's security led some delegations to advise athletes to use burner phones and laptops.\\n\\n6. **Athlete Absences**: Some top athletes, considered medal contenders, were unable to travel to China after testing positive for COVID-19, even if asymptomatic. This included athletes like Austrian ski jumper Marita Kramer and Russian skeletonist Nikita Tregubov.\\n\\n7. **Complaints and Controversies**: There were complaints from athletes and team officials about quarantine conditions, including issues with food, facilities, and lack of training equipment. Some athletes expressed frustration over the testing process and quarantine management.\\n\\n8. **COVID-19 Cases**: A total of 437 COVID-19 cases were reported during the Olympics, with 171 cases among the protective bubble residents and 266 detected from airport testing. Despite strict containment efforts, the number of cases was only slightly lower than those reported during the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics.\\n\\nOverall, COVID-19 significantly influenced the organization, participation, and experience of the 2022 Winter Olympics.\""
