    "# GPT-5 新しいパラメータとツール\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-5シリーズでは、モデルの応答をより細かく制御できる新しい開発者向けコントロールを導入しています。出力の長さやスタイルの調整から、厳密なフォーマットの強制まで、幅広い制御が可能です。以下は最新機能の概要です：\n",
    "\n",
    "| # | 機能 | 概要 | 値 / 使用方法 |\n",
    "|----|---------|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| 1. | **冗長性パラメータ** | モデルの回答をより詳細にしたり、簡潔にしたりするヒントを与えます。プロンプトを安定させ、書き直しの代わりにパラメータを使用できます。 | • **low** → 簡潔なUX、最小限の文章<br>• **medium** *(デフォルト)* → バランスの取れた詳細度<br>• **high** → 冗長、監査、教育、引き継ぎに最適 |\n",
    "| 2. | **自由形式関数呼び出し** | PythonスクリプトからSQLクエリまで、生のテキストペイロードをJSONラッピングなしで直接カスタムツールに生成します。以下のような外部ランタイムに対してより大きな柔軟性を提供：<br>• コードサンドボックス（Python、C++、Java等）<br>• SQLデータベース<br>• シェル環境<br>• 設定ジェネレータ | 構造化されたJSONが不要で、生のテキストがターゲットツールにとってより自然な場合に使用します。 |\n",
    "| 3. | **文脈自由文法（CFG）** | 言語における有効な文字列を定義する生成規則のセット。各規則は、周囲の文脈に依存せずに、非終端記号を終端記号や他の非終端記号に書き換えます。プログラミング言語やOpenAIツールのカスタム形式の構文に出力を制約するのに有用です。 | 文法で受け入れられる有効な文字列のみをモデルが出力することを保証する契約として使用します。 |\n",
    "| 4. | **最小推論** | レイテンシを最小化し、最初のトークンまでの時間を短縮するため、推論トークンを少なくまたは全く使わずにGPT-5を実行します。説明が不要な決定論的で軽量なタスク（抽出、フォーマット、短い書き換え、単純な分類）に最適です。指定されない場合、努力レベルはmediumがデフォルトです。 | 推論努力を「minimal」に設定。マルチステップ計画やツール集約的なワークフローでは避けてください。 |\n",
