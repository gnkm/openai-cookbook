    "# 検索APIと再ランキングを使用した質問応答\n",
    "\n",
    "関連情報の検索は時として干し草の山から針を探すような作業に感じられることがありますが、絶望する必要はありません。GPTは実際にこの作業の多くを代行してくれます。このガイドでは、既存の検索システムを様々なAI技術で強化し、ノイズを取り除く方法を探ります。\n",
    "\n",
    "GPTに情報を取得させる方法は2つあります：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **人間のブラウジングの模倣：** [GPTが検索をトリガー](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#browsing)し、結果を評価し、必要に応じて検索クエリを修正します。また、特定の検索結果をフォローアップして思考の連鎖を形成することもでき、これは人間のユーザーが行うのと同様です。\n",
    "2. **埋め込みによる検索：** コンテンツとユーザークエリの[埋め込み](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)を計算し、コサイン類似度で測定した最も関連性の高い[コンテンツを取得](Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb)します。この技術はGoogleなどの検索エンジンで[広く使用](https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/)されています。\n",
    "\n",
    "これらのアプローチはどちらも有望ですが、それぞれに欠点があります。1つ目は反復的な性質により遅くなる可能性があり、2つ目は知識ベース全体を事前に埋め込み、新しいコンテンツを継続的に埋め込み、ベクトルデータベースを維持する必要があります。\n",
    "\n",
    "これらのアプローチを組み合わせ、[再ランキング](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html)手法からインスピレーションを得ることで、中間的なアプローチを特定しました。**このアプローチは、Slack検索APIや社内データを持つElasticSearchインスタンスなど、既存の検索システムの上に実装できます**。動作方法は以下の通りです：\n",
    "\n",
    "![search_augmented_by_query_generation_and_embeddings_reranking.png](../images/search_rerank_answer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ステップ1：検索**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ユーザーが質問をします。\n",
    "2. GPTが潜在的なクエリのリストを生成します。\n",
    "3. 検索クエリが並列で実行されます。\n",
    "\n",
    "**ステップ2：再ランキング**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 各結果の埋め込みを使用して、ユーザーの質問に対する生成された仮想的な理想的回答との意味的類似度を計算します。\n",
    "2. この類似度メトリックに基づいて結果がランク付けされ、フィルタリングされます。\n",
    "\n",
    "**ステップ3：回答**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 上位の検索結果を与えられて、モデルはユーザーの質問に対する回答を参考文献とリンクを含めて生成します。\n",
    "\n",
    "このハイブリッドアプローチは比較的低いレイテンシを提供し、ベクトルデータベースの維持を必要とせずに既存の検索エンドポイントに統合できます。詳しく見ていきましょう！例として[News API](https://newsapi.org/)を検索対象のドメインとして使用します。\n",
    "\n",
    "## セットアップ\n",
