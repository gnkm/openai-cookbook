    "# 補完をストリーミングする方法\n",
    "\n",
    "デフォルトでは、OpenAIに補完をリクエストすると、補完全体が生成されてから単一のレスポンスで送り返されます。\n",
    "\n",
    "長い補完を生成している場合、レスポンスを待つのに数秒かかることがあります。\n",
    "\n",
    "より早くレスポンスを得るために、生成されている補完を「ストリーミング」することができます。これにより、完全な補完が完了する前に、補完の最初の部分の印刷や処理を開始できます。\n",
    "\n",
    "補完をストリーミングするには、チャット補完または補完エンドポイントを呼び出す際に`stream=True`を設定します。これにより、[データのみのサーバー送信イベント](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format)としてレスポンスをストリーミングバックするオブジェクトが返されます。`message`フィールドではなく`delta`フィールドからチャンクを抽出してください。\n",
    "\n",
    "## デメリット\n",
    "\n",
    "本番アプリケーションで`stream=True`を使用すると、部分的な補完は評価が困難になる可能性があるため、補完のコンテンツをモデレートすることがより困難になることに注意してください。これは[承認された使用方法](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines)に影響を与える可能性があります。\n",
    "\n",
    "## サンプルコード\n",
    "\n",
    "以下、このノートブックでは次のことを示します：\n",
    "1. 典型的なチャット補完レスポンスがどのように見えるか\n",
    "2. ストリーミングチャット補完レスポンスがどのように見えるか\n",
    "3. チャット補完をストリーミングすることでどれだけ時間が節約されるか\n",
    "4. ストリーミングされたチャット補完レスポンスのトークン使用量データを取得する方法"
