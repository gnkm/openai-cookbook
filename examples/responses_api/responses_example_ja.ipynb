    "## Responses APIとは？\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses APIは、OpenAIモデルと対話するための新しい方法で、従来のAPIよりもシンプルで柔軟性に優れた設計となっています。複数のツールを使用し、マルチターン会話を処理し、（テキストだけでなく）さまざまなタイプのデータを扱う高度なAIアプリケーションを簡単に構築できます。\n",
    "\n",
    "主にテキスト用に構築されたChat Completionsや、多くのセットアップが必要なAssistants APIなどの古いAPIとは異なり、Responses APIは以下の機能のために一から構築されています：\n",
    "\n",
    "- シームレスなマルチターン対話（単一のAPI呼び出しで複数のステップにわたって会話を継続）\n",
    "- 強力なホストツールへの簡単なアクセス（ファイル検索、ウェブ検索、コードインタープリターなど）\n",
    "- モデルに送信するコンテキストの細かい制御\n",
    "\n",
    "AIモデルが複雑で長時間実行される推論をより適切に処理できるようになるにつれて、開発者は非同期かつステートフルなAPIを必要としています。Responses APIは、これらのニーズを満たすように設計されています。\n",
    "\n",
    "このガイドでは、Responses APIが提供する新機能の一部と、始めるのに役立つ実用的な例をご紹介します。"

      "        \"text\": \"As of February 25, 2025, several significant developments have emerged in the field of artificial intelligence (AI):\\n\\n**Huawei's Advancements in AI Chip Production**\\n\\nHuawei has notably enhanced its AI chip production capabilities, increasing the yield rate of its Ascend 910C processors from 20% to nearly 40%. This improvement has rendered the production line profitable for the first time and is pivotal for China's ambition to achieve self-sufficiency in advanced semiconductors. Despite these strides, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market in China, attributed to its user-friendly software and widespread adoption. Huawei aims to further elevate its yield rate to 60% and plans to produce 100,000 Ascend 910C processors and 300,000 910B chips in 2025. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/f46b7f6d-62ed-4b64-8ad7-2417e5ab34f6?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\\n\\n**Apple's $500 Billion U.S. Investment Plan**\\n\\nApple has unveiled a substantial $500 billion investment strategy in the United States over the next four years. This plan encompasses the creation of 20,000 new jobs and the establishment of a major facility in Texas dedicated to manufacturing artificial intelligence servers. President Donald Trump has lauded this initiative, viewing it as a testament to the confidence in his administration. Concurrently, Wall Street has experienced further losses due to concerns over a potential economic slowdown, exacerbated by tariffs. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/feb/24/euro-hits-one-month-high-german-election-result-stock-markets-dax-bank-of-england-business-live-news?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\\n\\n**Microsoft Adjusts AI Data Center Investments**\\n\\nMicrosoft has canceled leases on U.S. data centers totaling several hundred megawatts, potentially affecting two large centers. This decision is reportedly linked to concerns about oversupply, following claims by Chinese competitor DeepSeek of developing a generative chatbot more efficiently than U.S. companies. Analysts suggest that Microsoft might be reallocating funds or responding to OpenAI's shift to Oracle for a $500 billion project. Despite being a leading AI investor with planned expenditures of $80 billion this year, Microsoft appears to be scaling back on massive spending initiatives, allowing significant data center agreements to lapse and citing facility and power delays. ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/02/24/business/microsoft-axes-some-ai-data-center-leases-td-cowen-says/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\\n\\n**Alibaba's $52 Billion Investment in AI and Cloud Infrastructure**\\n\\nAlibaba Group has announced plans to invest over $52 billion in artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure over the next three years, surpassing its total investment in these areas over the past decade. This strategic move underscores Alibaba's commitment to AI-driven growth and reinforces its position as a leading global cloud provider. Following this announcement, Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares experienced a 3% drop in premarket trading. Analysts view this investment as aligning with market expectations and indicative of Alibaba Cloud's significant capital expenditure compared to peers. ([investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/alibaba-plans-to-invest-usd52b-in-ai-cloud-over-next-three-years-11684981?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\\n\\n**JPMorgan's Investment in AI-Driven Chemical Development**\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase's private investment arm has led a $20 million growth investment in Albert Invent, an AI-driven chemical development platform, valuing the company at $270 million. This funding will enable Albert Invent to expand globally and increase its workforce from 120 to over 200 employees by the end of the year. The company assists chemists in developing new formulations and materials, significantly accelerating chemical experiments. For instance, Albert's platform can simulate 100,000 experiments in 10 minutes for clients like Nouryon Chemicals.
