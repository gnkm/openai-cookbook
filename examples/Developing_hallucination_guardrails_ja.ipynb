Thank you for letting us know!\" - If possible, offer a small token of appreciation (e.g., discount or voucher for future purchases). 4. **Responding to Negative Feedback** - Apologize sincerely and acknowledge the customer's concerns: \"We apologize that our product did not meet your expectations. Your feedback is important to us.\" - Ask for additional details if necessary to understand the issue better. - Reassure the customer that their feedback will be escalated to the product development team. 5. **Responding to Suggestions** - Acknowledge the suggestion: \"Thank you for your suggestion. We value input from our customers as it helps us improve our products.\" - Inform the customer that their suggestion will be reviewed: \"We will share your idea with our product team for further consideration.\" 6. **Internal Processing** - Log all feedback under the respective category in the internal database. - Forward detailed feedback to the product development team bi-weekly. - High-priority issues should be escalated immediately to the senior management team. 7. **Follow-Up** - Monitor whether the customer's feedback leads to any product updates or changes. - If the customer’s feedback resulted in product enhancement, send a follow-up email to inform them: \"Thank you for your valuable feedback. We wanted to let you know that we've made some improvements based on your input.\" 8. **Closing the Loop** - Ask if there is anything else you can assist the customer with: \"Is there anything else we can help you with today?\" - Close the ticket once all queries and feedback are appropriately addressed. 9. **Continuous Improvement** - Analyze feedback trends monthly to identify recurring issues and areas for improvement. - Use feedback insights for product development meetings and strategic planning sessions. By following these steps, we ensure that customer feedback is valued, documented, and acted upon to continuously improve our product offerings.</td>\n",

    "ハルシネーション・ガードレールを構築する際の指針となる原則は以下の通りです：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 回答が正確かどうかを評価するための非常に記述的なメトリクスを提供する\n",
    "- 「真実」という概念を、測定可能で容易に識別できるメトリクスに分解することが重要です\n",
    "- 真実性や関連性などのメトリクスは測定が困難です。ステートメントを採点する具体的な方法を提供することで、より正確なガードレールを実現できます\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 重要な用語の一貫性を確保する\n",
    "- ナレッジベース記事、アシスタント、ユーザーなどの関連用語をプロンプト全体で一貫して使用することが重要です\n",
    "- アシスタント対エージェントなどの異なる表現を使い始めると、モデルが混乱する可能性があります\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 最も高度なモデルから始める\n",
    "- 最も高度なモデルを使用する際には、コストと品質のトレードオフがあります。GPT-4oはより高価かもしれませんが、高い精度を確保するために最も高度なモデルから始めることが重要です\n",
    "- ガードレールを十分にテストし、その性能に確信が持てるようになったら、gpt-3.5-turboにチューニングダウンしてコストを削減することを検討できます\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 各文を独立して評価し、回答全体も全体として評価する\n",
    "- エージェントが長い回答を返す場合、回答を個別の文に分解して独立して評価することが有用です\n",
    "- それに加えて、メッセージ全体の意図を全体として評価することで、重要なコンテキストを失わないようにできます\n",
    "\n",
    "これらすべてを念頭に置いて、ガードレールシステムを構築し、その性能を測定してみましょう。"
